// Enhancements;
//   DONE - only start from preset value on first iteration - move out of function
//   DONE - then use incremental adjustments
//   DONE - don't keep going, use threshold value for 'close enough'
//   DONE - can't assume loopcount, need to track min/max values (and maybe iterations)?
