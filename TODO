firmware:

 - pin re-assignments following SMD re-design
 - conditionally exclude all 32kHz crystal code, wakeup from watchdog?

hardware:

 - possible swap to TB6612FNG SMD IC (replace Sparkfun breakout module)
 - add test points to schematic DONE
 - ISP connector a bit tight to the edge of the Xbee board,
   move to allow some more clearance for cable header
