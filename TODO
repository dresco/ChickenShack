firmware:

 - pin re-assignments following SMD re-design DONE
 - conditionally exclude all 32kHz crystal code, wakeup from watchdog? DONE & DONE
 - change battery ADC constants to reflect new resistor values DONE

hardware:

 - possible swap to TB6612FNG SMD IC (replace Sparkfun breakout module)
 - ISP connector a bit tight to the edge of the Xbee board,
   move to allow some more clearance for cable header DONE
 - tidy wiring loom, get rid of scotch blocks (solder & shrink wrap)
